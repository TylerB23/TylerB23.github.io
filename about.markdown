I'm an udergraduate studying Applied Mathematics at 
Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.

My major concentration is primarily in mathematical modeling. At a high level, that entails
framing problems about systems in mathematical terms in order to better understand both the
problem assumptions and the behavior of the system at hand. In class, I've mostly done this through
a variety of biological courses, including the core systems biology courses at CWRU and a course
on stochastic biological models.

Besides the major in applied math, I'm studying computer science and music as well.
My interest in computer science is practical and theoretical. First, while it may have been
practical 100 years ago to model systems on paper and pencil, virtually all mathematicians today
involved in the practice will use some sort of computer simulations in their work. Second, I really
like solving problems and the ways computer science makes that possible for me. I'm an avid Linux
user, and I have a lot of fun playing in config files, doing things faster with the command line,
and customizing my experience with the OS. That's how I ended up making this website!

On the music side of things, I've played the french horn for about 10 years,
and I've been recently learning to play guitar. I'll listen to nearly anything, but some of my
favorite artists include Kendrick Lamar, Radiohead, Kanye, Vulfpeck, Kamasi Washington, and
Thundercat.

I've conducted research in data science at the [Solar Durability and Lifetime
Extension](https://engineering.case.edu/centers/sdle/), where I helpd write and package several R
packages for the analysis of photovoltaic system long-term performance. In the process, I've learned
a lot about the R programming language and software packaging in general.

This website is hosted by github pages from my github repo (link in the footer).
It  makes use of the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
