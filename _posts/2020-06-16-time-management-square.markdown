The below is an email I sent to my fraternity chapter last semester, during the
period where we fould ourselves stuck at home. I am the Director of Member
Development, in charge of programming related to 'development', in all the forms
that that takes, and a member of the executive board with the goal of forming a
cohesive, growth-oriented experience across the 4 years any of our members are
undergraduates. When the pandemic interrupted our plans for the semester, many
of us in leadership roles adapted as best we could. I felt this was an
interesting write-up on one of my favorite time management strategies. I include
most of the email body below. Enjoy!

### The Eisenhower Square ###
This is a strategy I use whenever I feel like I've got a lot on my plate and
it's going to be hard to prioritise and get it all done. 4 quick steps:
- Write down everything you need to get done that you're aware of
  - Homework, chores, things due in a month, test prep, etc.
- Next to each item, indicate with a "U" if it's Urgent
  - This depends on the size of the time. For example, a one page reflection is
   probably only urgent when it's due in 24 hours, but studying for a midterm is
   probably urgent 5 days out.
- Next to each item, indicate with an "I" if it's Important
  - Is this meaningful to you? Does it help you achieve your goals or reflect
    your values? Are there others counting on you to do this?
  - For example, MCAT review is definitely important, but daily reflections for
    class may not be to you
- Next to each item, indicate with "RN" if it can be done Right Now
  - Would it take you five minutes or less?
  - For example, sending an email, writing up finished homework, washing your
    face, etc.

Once you've done that, fill out the square:

1. Right Now (RN)
  - Do this stuff right now! The *quick win* of acomplishing something will prep
    you to succeed all day long
2. Important and Urgent (IU)
  - This stuff should be your *Top Priority*
3. Not Important, but Urgent (nIU)
  - Once the stuff above is done, evaluate these items. Can they be *delegated*
    or *postponed*?
  - If not, get them done now, too. If you get daily, small assignments for
    example, they'll
    probably land here.
4. Important, but not Urgent (InU)
  - If you have extra time today, you might get to this stuff. But if not, don't
    sweat it!
  - What's most valuable is to *set a schedule* for when you will get these
    things done. Keep in mind due dates and size of the task.
5. Not Important and Not Urgent (nInU)
  - *Re-evaluate* why this stuff made it on your list at all. Is there any value
    here?
  - Identify what value exists, and determine if this is something to *scrap*,
    something to *schedule*, or something to *reconsider* in some other way.

Here's my list for today. Next to each item, I indicate with I/nI, U/nU, or RN
for right now.

- Write up 422 - I,U
- Home Reading for 422 - I,nU
