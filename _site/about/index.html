        <p>I started this blog while an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University.
The combination of pandemic isolation and taking almost entirely math
classes led me to seek out a creative outlet, which is why I started this blog.
Today, I work in investment banking in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>In school, I studied Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Finance. My
major was primarily concerned with mathematical modeling, especially in
biological applications. I took most of the core systems biology courses while
in school. About midway through, I realized I had no real idea what I wanted to
do after undergrad. That led me to the business school, where I developed an
interest in finance and picked up the minor. After two summers spent doing
research on campus (more on that below), I interned with KeyBanc Capital Markets
and ultimately took a full-time position there after graduating.</p>

<p>I enjoy my career and everything it’s afforded me, from the personal development
to the professional network with some really wonderful people. It’s taught me a
lot of the soft skills that math majors stereotypically don’t have, but more
than that, I like to say it’s taught me competency. I suppose a psychologist
might call it concientiousness. Being in the work environment, especially at an
investment bank, has forced me to become much more organized and tenacious. In
undergrad, I often agonized for a week or more about sending an email to someone
I didn’t know well. That obviously doesn’t fly at the office. I’ve quickly grown as a
professional and as a person in the time since graduating.</p>

<p>In college I used Linux on my personal computer. I built my first PC when I was
13, but forgot to budget for the cost of Windows, which led me to using Ubuntu
for a few months. I still enjoy messing around with hardware and software today,
though I’m now using a Mac at home - fewer things go wrong with it, and I don’t
have the time to do the troubleshooting I used to do in college.</p>

<p>In 2019 and 2020, I conducted research in data science at the <a href="https://engineering.case.edu/centers/sdle/">Solar Durability and Lifetime
Extension Center</a>, where I assisted
in  writing and packaging several R packages for the analysis of 
photovoltaic system long-term performance. In the process, I learned
a lot about the R programming language and software packaging in general.</p>

<p>Later in undergrad, I did an REU with my advisor in the Math department. The
research topic was the effect of asymmetric mitosis on population structures. I
also took part in some reading groups with grad students studying mathematical
biology, and assisted my advisor in one of his research projects on information
transmission in biological systems. The math was very difficult and very
interesting to me, though by the end of my schooling I came to recognize that
biological applications weren’t totally for me. I was quickly becoming
interested in financial mathematics, especially as I began to recognize some
parallels between the two disciplines.</p>

<p>I’ve played the french horn for about 10 years, and I’ve been recently learning to 
play guitar. I’ll listen to nearly anything, but some of my
favorite artists include Kendrick Lamar, Radiohead, Kanye, Vulfpeck, Kamasi Washington, and
Thundercat.</p>
