<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was about 13 when I built my first PC with a combination of savings,
birthday and christmas money, and help from a copious number of Youtube
tutorials. I still remember my panic when the internet didn’t immediately work, and
I had to run out to TigerDirect to buy a WiFi adapter (whoops!). Since then I’ve
built about a dozen or so systems for family and friends, and found out I
wasn’t alone - it seems to be a common beginner mistake to assume once you have
all the parts put together, the machine should just work like a prebuilt.</p>

<p>The other side of this is the $100 cost for a Windows installation disk. Turns
out there’s no better way to turn a 13 year old into a Linux user than to ask
him for even more money after he’s made the biggest purchase of his life. While
I eventually turned over the Microsoft tax (since Linux gaming support wasn’t exactly
the best in 2013), I spent several weeks on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, with the Gnome
desktop environment.</p>

<p>This first foray into Linux and FOSS was pretty huge for me. While I didn’t
understand what I was doing then, using the command line to install drivers and
solving my own problems (while creating a good amount too!) was magical to me.
When I left for college and got my first laptop, I immediately dual-booted it
with Ubuntu 18.04 and Gnome.</p>

<p>This worked great for a while, and I steadily used Windows 10 less and less as I
got more used to the configurability and ease of use of Ubuntu and gnome. When I
started doing data science research with the Solar Durability and Lifetime
Extension center on campus, being familiar with Linux was a huge bonus. All of
the graduate students and PI’s used Ubuntu and KDE, and the Raspberry Pi’s we
primarily used to connect to the University’s HPC were configured with Raspbian.</p>

<p>My laptop had a touchscreen, so I thought I was smart to be using Gnome with
its larger UI and (in my mind) more elegant design compared to the slow,
cluttered KDE environments I used on the HPC. But a friend of mine in the lab
showed me his XFCE setup and how deeply customized he had made it. It was around
this time that I switched to Manjaro just for the sake of more frequent updates
and better driver support on my Razer Blade Stealth, and I decided to make the
jump to KDE as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<h3 id="global-themeplasma-style">Global Theme/Plasma Style</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a> as my global theme. It’s a fantastic dark color scheme, with a
lot of nice purples and greens, but perhaps most importantly, it exists for a
ton of applications. The dracula theme is consistent across my desktop
environment, my firefox top bar, my vim and konsole colors, etc. For the global
theme, I opened system settings -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Global Themes -&gt; Get New Global
Themes.. and searched for it. I use it for my window decorations and Plasma
style as well, both in the Appearance tab as well in KDE’s system settings.
<img src="/assets/Screenshot_20200426_175508.png" alt="global theme" />
I’ve also tried out <a href="https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic">Nordic</a>, which is a gorgeous, more matte option. I prefer
Dracula, but I have no qualms recommending that one as well.</p>

<h3 id="icons">Icons</h3>
<p>For Icons, I use <a href="https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-icon-theme">Tela</a>. I really like how well the colors here pair with
Dracula. You can follow the link to the github for installation instructions,
but I just went from system settings -&gt; Icons -&gt; Get New Icons… since that was
easy.</p>

<h3 id="other-fun-stuff">Other Fun Stuff</h3>
<p>I love using virtual desktops to keep some semblance of order between my various
assignments and classes throughout the day. Often I’ll have 4 desktops: one for
editing assignments and reading them from Canvas, one for textbook PDF’s and
other reference material, one for reserve/putting other classwork out of mind,
and one for Spotify and whatever else is running in the background. I already
use hotkeys to open applications and for whatever is running, so having keys to
switch between desktops can get tricky. I much prefer the MacOS approach of
having decent touchpad support, but this isn’t built into KDE/Manjaro.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures">libinput-gestures</a> for this. Simply put, it lets you configure your
touchpad to recognize gesture inputs however you’d like. I followed it’s install
guide to a T, installing the library from the AUR. I just use the defaults to
3-finger swipe between virtual desktops, but there’s a ton of config options
detailed on the github.</p>

<p>On the desktop, I use <a href="https://github.com/KDE/latte-dock">latte-dock</a>, and specifically the Plasma layout. I’ve
tried it at the top and bottom, and prefer having as small a GUI as possible to
help me focus on whatever I’m working on. The bar is the least intrusive, most
intuitive metaphor for me, since I often find using pop-up panels gets annoying
when mousing around the screen. YMMV, of course.</p>

<h4 id="command-line-goodies">Command Line Goodies</h4>
<p>I really, really love the aesthetic and convenience of [yakuake]. It comes by
default on Manjaro KDE and makes interacting with the command line super easy. I
use Ctrl + Tab to bring it up, and F12 to fullscreen it (both set in System
Settings -&gt; Shortcuts). If I’m coding alongside a tutorial or something like
that, I’ll split screen with Konsole, but usually I prefer the drop-down.</p>

<p>Within the console, I use <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> to organize my workspace. Tmux is a terminal
multiplexer, which basically lets you interact with multiple instances of the
command line in one window. I might use 10% of its capabilities – it’s a hugely
useful app – but I can’t get by without it now. Ham Vocke has an awesome intro
to it on <a href="https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/">his website</a> detailing how useful it is to him as a full-time
programmer. I’d strongly suggest that post and his follow-ups as an intro to
using the app. Here’s a link to my current config file, which is largely poached
from various Reddit users and public github repos: 
<a href="/assets/tmux.conf">.tmux.conf</a></p>

<p>Within the command line, I replaced my prompt with <a href="https://starship.rs/">starship.rs</a>, which is
wonderfully customizable. It lets me customize what the prompt looks like and
what information is included with it each time a command runs. I use it to
remind me what virtual environment I might be on, what git branch I’m on and
whether it’s updated remotely, and get rough timings of commands.
<img src="/assets/Screenshot_20200426_182710.png" alt="tmux and starship" /></p>

<p>And here’s a link to my configuration file: <a href="/assets/starship.toml">config</a> I
only use a small portion of the languages it can recognize. Checkout the
website for more!</p>

<p>Lastly, it’s worth mentioning that I’ve themed out my Vim, Konsole, Firefox, and
tmux with the <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a> theme. Check out their documentation for installation of
each of these. Unfortunately, since the theme supports so many platforms, the
documentation is very general and I found myself going through a fair amount of
stackoverflow threads looking for small fixes (including spending about 20
minutes looking for a hidden file! fun times all around). Joking aside, I’ll
link my .bashrc and .vimrc below for your utility/amusement:
<a href="/assets/bashrc">.bashrc</a>
<a href="/assets/vimrc">.vimrc</a></p>
