<p>The below is an email I sent to my fraternity chapter last semester, during the
period where we fould ourselves stuck at home. I am the Director of Member
Development, in charge of programming related to ‘development’, in all the forms
that that takes, and a member of the executive board with the goal of forming a
cohesive, growth-oriented experience across the 4 years any of our members are
undergraduates. When the pandemic interrupted our plans for the semester, many
of us in leadership roles adapted as best we could. I felt this was an
interesting write-up on one of my favorite time management strategies. I include
most of the email body below. Enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="the-eisenhower-square">The Eisenhower Square</h3>
<p>This is a strategy I use whenever I feel like I’ve got a lot on my plate and
it’s going to be hard to prioritise and get it all done. 4 quick steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write down everything you need to get done that you’re aware of
    <ul>
      <li>Homework, chores, things due in a month, test prep, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next to each item, indicate with a “U” if it’s Urgent
    <ul>
      <li>This depends on the size of the time. For example, a one page reflection is
 probably only urgent when it’s due in 24 hours, but studying for a midterm is
 probably urgent 5 days out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next to each item, indicate with an “I” if it’s Important
    <ul>
      <li>Is this meaningful to you? Does it help you achieve your goals or reflect
your values? Are there others counting on you to do this?</li>
      <li>For example, MCAT review is definitely important, but daily reflections for
class may not be to you</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next to each item, indicate with “RN” if it can be done Right Now
    <ul>
      <li>Would it take you five minutes or less?</li>
      <li>For example, sending an email, writing up finished homework, washing your
face, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve done that, fill out the square:
<img src="/assets/eisenhower.png" alt="eisenhower" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Right Now (RN)
    <ul>
      <li>Do this stuff right now! The <strong>quick win</strong> of acomplishing something will prep
 you to succeed all day long</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Important and Urgent (IU)
    <ul>
      <li>This stuff should be your <strong>Top Priority</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Not Important, but Urgent (nIU)
    <ul>
      <li>Once the stuff above is done, evaluate these items. Can they be <strong>delegated</strong>
 or <strong>postponed</strong>?</li>
      <li>If not, get them done now, too. If you get daily, small assignments for
 example, they’ll
 probably land here.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Important, but not Urgent (InU)
    <ul>
      <li>If you have extra time today, you might get to this stuff. But if not, don’t
 sweat it!</li>
      <li>What’s most valuable is to <strong>set a schedule</strong> for when you will get these
 things done. Keep in mind due dates and size of the task.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Not Important and Not Urgent (nInU)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Re-evaluate</strong> why this stuff made it on your list at all. Is there any value
 here?</li>
      <li>Identify what value exists, and determine if this is something to <strong>scrap</strong>,
 something to <strong>schedule</strong>, or something to <strong>reconsider</strong> in some other way.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s my list for today. Next to each item, I indicate with I/nI, U/nU, or RN
for right now.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish 422 Homework - I,U</li>
  <li>Write up 422 - I,U</li>
  <li>Home Reading for 422 - I,nU</li>
  <li>read 319 Paper - I,nU</li>
